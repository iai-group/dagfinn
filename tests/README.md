# Run tests

To run the tests locally use command:

```
pytest
```

You should get a detailed report with all passed and failed tests.
Additionally, there should be a full coverage report of the test suite with all the missing lines.


**NB!** To increase the coverage of your tests, make sure that as many lines are covered as possible.
